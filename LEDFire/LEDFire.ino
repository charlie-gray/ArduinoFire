/* LED Strip Fire (2020)
 * Made with <3 by Charlie Gray :)
 * 
 * REQUIREMENTS:
 * Make sure that the FastLED lib is installed
 * 
 * NOTE:
 * Make sure that you don't run too many LEDs off 
 * of the Arduino 5v internal power pin. Use a power
 * supply in that case instead. 
 * 
 * Also remember to uncomment the strip that you are 
 * using below.
